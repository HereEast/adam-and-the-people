Homepage should work:
1. Loader overlay >> Animated logo while photos are loading
2. Loader overlay goes up when all images are loaded
3. Container with images goes up together with loader overlay
4. You can see certain amount of images in a viewport
5. When you scroll down, images that were below the viewport, fade in (Haven't implemented yet)
6. Reload page on click on logo

Input range should work:
1. Change image size with input range
2. Updated size is saved after reload (during current session)

Popup should work:
1. Popup on click
2. Swipe images with Left/Right arrows and with click on Left/Right side of the viewport
3. On mobile just swipe Left/Right
4. Close popup on button "Close" and Escape

Treats:
1. Logo is animated on hover

///////

Fix:
1. Loader overlay animation while images are loaded (it's stuck)
2. How to hide loader not on timer, but when all images are loaded?
3. How to load 155 images that have to be of high resolution since they can be scaled full screen width?
4. Code structure
